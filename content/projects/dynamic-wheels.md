My Final Project for my degree. An experiment to design simple wheels that could be used in a wide variety of terrains by redeploying into either a standard wheel configuration or a hooked configuration, depending on needs.
The power of 3D printing allowed us to both save on manufacturing costs and use novel materials. Particularly at the scale we were working at, we needed the ability to create precise gearing and interfaces between parts, with low tolerance for error.
We created a print-in-place design measuring only a few cm in diameter, which allowed us to use a very simple robot frame for testing.
Using a high-strength polymer as our base, which bonded to a soft rubber for gripping, we were able to successfully manufacture several working prototypes and create a working demo.
