A project I'm very proud of. Over the span of a few months, our 12-person group designed a motorcycle-sized engine from the ground up. Our only fundamental restriction was on the engine volume, but we our end goal was an overall viable product with reasonable cost, weight and so on.

The team was split into three parts, each primarily (but not entirely) focusing on a specific section. I was the leader of Team 2, whose main focus was the physical side of things. With combustion calculations from Team 1 and material calculations from Team 3, we created the 3D model that would be the source of truth for all our efforts. In the last weeks of the project, once the initial model was complete, we took point on optimizing the model to cut down on material usage, optimize our cooling solution, and more.

The engine is a two-cylinder, 1534cc motorcycle engine, laid out in a 90Â° V-twin configuration for reduced vibration, designed with a suggested retail price of $5,511. It has a dry weight of 83.5 kg and a wet weight of 87 kg. The Patriot engine provides a maximum power output of 79.98 kW at 6000 rpm, and a maximum torque of 144.34 N-m at 4000. Its over-square cylinders with a bore-to-stroke ratio of 1.2 drive a four-stroke Otto cycle with a compression ratio of 10:1.
