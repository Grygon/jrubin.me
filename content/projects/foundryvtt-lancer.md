One of a handful of collaborators working on implementing the Lancer RPG system in FoundryVTT since Summer of 2020. Foundry is a highly extendable platform, allowing developers to plug in directly with anything that can be accomplished via normal web development. 
With the team, we've managed to implement over 20 unique Entities for property entry and tracking, as well as a complex underlying framework for automatic calculation.
